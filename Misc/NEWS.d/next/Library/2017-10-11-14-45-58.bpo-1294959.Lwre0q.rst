Introduce a ``platsubdir`` sysconfig variable that contains the name of the
platform-specific "lib" directory. This is used to construct paths that do
not differ by prefix, i.e., ``/usr/lib`` vs ``/usr/lib64``. The
``posix_prefix`` install scheme is changed to take this into account.

By default, this is ``basename $libdir``, but can be overriden by
``./configure --with-custom-platsubdir``.
